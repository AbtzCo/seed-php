Use this as a tool to generate random (fake) data and consume it as a temporary RESTful API 
while developing web or mobile applications without need to use the real RESTful API from 
production, or even fake data using local JSON files and other.

Yah, yah! I know there's a lot of other services like this. So, you'd be asking your-self *why 
should you use this one instead of other existing out there*, right? That's simple, because 
this API was designed to be far more flexible than any other out there. ;)

To learn more about how it's really flexible, just take a look at [Resources](#api-Resources)
